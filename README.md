## 3 How the project works?
The project consists of an e-commerce store, I used the Nike website and some products as an example. </br> 
In this project there is a connection between the front-end and the back-end, in the back-end we used a REST API connected with my PostgreSql, </br>
a connection made with Axios, and an Express to create the server. On the front-end I used Vite,  </br> 
as I believe it is much easier and more organized when it comes to React Js.
